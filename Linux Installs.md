# Linux Installs

This is a list of apps I like to install on most or all linux installations.

## Common

- **Fira Code Font**
- **Nala** - For apt based distros. Improves upon apt functions
- **~~neofetch~~** - archived needs replaced
- **screenfetch** - Trying to replace neofetch. May also try macchina.
- **openssh**
- **TLDR** - a really nice help with syntax for many apps and commands
- **VS Code [Insiders]** - Code for stable, Insiders when less mission critical
- **thefuck** - mistype correction suggestions
- **eza** ls replacement
- **Atuin** - CLI history database
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer
- **7zip**

## Situational

- **Pacstall** - AUR for Ubuntu
- **Java**
- **nautilus-dropbox**
- **playonlinux** - I'm not sure if they're still updating this but on a more daily driver this is helpful with gaming on linux
- **ROS** - robot operating system
- **Steam**
- **Teamviewer** - If I ever get around to buying a liccense maybe I'll start using this again \shrug
- **ubuntu-restricted-addons** - I'm still not entirely sure what this adds but it's obviously ubuntu specific
- **WINE**
- **Chrome**
- **Dyslexic Font**
- **Etcher**
- **Homebrew** - Access to other utilities
- **chezmoi** - sync files accross installs
- **dust** - replace du/df also kinda like windirstat
- **btop** - looks nicer than htop
- **restic** - backup solution
